# R Markdown

I am exploring the capabilities of Markdown in RStudio.

```{r first}
x <- "variable"
print(x)
```

## Including Plots

What is the scope of my variable x? Can it be seen in the following code chunk?

```{r scope}
print(x)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
